# PET/CT project
Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are essential in assisting radiologists diagnose lung cancer more quickly, and accurately, with fewer diagnostic errors. the aim of this study is To automatically diagnose lung cancer from 2D (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

This study which was approved by Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IR.SUMS.REC.1401.715) included patients who were recruited from Kowsar charity hospital, in Shiraz, Iran. 

The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is the most effective algorithm for improving deep learning in computer vision. In this study, some of the most popular and well-designed deep convolutional networks were utilized. Transfer learning is the primary technique employed, enabling the networks to benefit from pre-learned knowledge rather than training them from scratch.
