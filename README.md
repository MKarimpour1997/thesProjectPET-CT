# PET/CT project
Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are essential in assisting radiologists diagnose lung cancer more quickly, and accurately, with fewer diagnostic errors. Here the aim of the study is To automatically diagnose lung cancer from 2D (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
